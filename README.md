# speedtest_4mers
I have the idea and some code from here:
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-fast-is-c-compared-to-python-978f18f474c7

I just put everything together and added some other languages.
Just check it out on your own if you want ^^

Note: The speedtest doesn't say wether a language is fast overall. Especially for Rust. Rust is very slow in this example because it's not possible to handle with strings like in other languages.
I'm not specialist in every language here so the code might not be perfect.

If you want to add a language or know how to do something better feel free to contribute ^^
